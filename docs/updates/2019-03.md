# March 2019

Welcome to the March 2019 Qlik Core update. We're highlighting a couple of important changes and improvements which we
hope you will like.

## Engine security enhancement

Because of a security concern and to follow best-practices, the Qlik Associative Engine Docker image is changing its
user and group from `nobody:nobody` to `1910:1910`. You can read more about using an unique UID/GID here:
[https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#user](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#user).

If you are on Mac or Linux and using Docker volume mounts, you may need to change the owner of the volume files. You can
do that with the following command:

```bash
chown -R 1910:1910 /YOUR-MOUNT
```

## Introducing hamus.js

We have grown tired of typing the same code every time we create a new react.js solution, so we decided to consolidate
reusable code into a new utility library called [hamus.js](https://github.com/qlik-oss/hamus.js). The repo utilizes
the new React hook API and offers a set of hooks which simplifies communication with the Qlik Associative Engine.

The repo comes with an example to get you started. Check it out at [hamus.js](https://github.com/qlik-oss/hamus.js).

## Usability fixes in catwalk

To increase usability when loading large applications (or with slow connections) we have added a loading screen.

## On the path to a corectl 1.0.0 release

We're in the last phases of finishing a 1.0.0 version of corectl. Focus of this release is to remove the experimental
flag and make the command structure stable. Along with necessary consistency changes in the API we are adding a
couple of requested features like bash completion, support for nested JSON structures and better error messages.

As always, you can follow the development in the [corectl repo](https://github.com/qlik-oss/corectl).

## Upcoming

In April, we will look further into our connector offering as well as the new filestreaming gRPC API released by engine.
Stay tuned!
